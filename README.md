This repository is my journey in C/C++ programming! I'm building this as a practice space to solidify my understanding of basic concepts like variables, data types, control flow (if-else statements, loops), and simple functions.

The code snippets and small programs here reflect my learning process. Feel free to explore them, suggest improvements, and share any beginner-friendly resources you've found helpful! Let's learn C/C++ together!

**Note:** This is a work in progress as I'm still learning.
